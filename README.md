# A tutorial to build your own Sky Imager with cloud coverage estimation

In this tutorial, you learn how to create your own custom made Sky Imager. You program a Raspberry Pi to instruct a camera to take pictures of the sky at regular intervals. You install a web interface to access the captured images and you apply signal processing techniques to compute the cloud coverage.

The main file is tutorial.pdf. This repository contains all the scripts required for the project.
